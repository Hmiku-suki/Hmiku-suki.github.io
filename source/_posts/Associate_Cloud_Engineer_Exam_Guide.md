    Tasks include:
    - Initializing data systems with products (e.g., Cloud SQL, Cloud Datastore, BigQuery, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Dataproc, Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Storage)
    - Loading data (e.g., command line upload, API transfer, import/export, load data from Cloud Storage, streaming data to Cloud Pub/Sub)
5. Deploying and implementing networking resources. 
    Tasks include:
    - Creating a VPC with subnets (e.g., custom-mode VPC, shared VPC)
    - Launching a Compute Engine instance with custom network configuration (e.g., internal-only IP address, Google private access, static external and private IP address, network tags)
    - Creating ingress and egress firewall rules for a VPC (e.g., IP subnets, tags, service accounts)
    - Creating a VPN between a Google VPC and an external network using Cloud VPN
    - Creating a load balancer to distribute application network traffic to an application (e.g., Global HTTP(S) load balancer, Global SSL Proxy load balancer, Global TCP Proxy load balancer, regional network load balancer, regional internal load balancer)
6. Deploying a solution using Cloud Marketplace. 
    Tasks include:
    - Browsing Cloud Marketplace catalog and viewing solution details
    - Deploying a Cloud Marketplace solution
7. Deploying application infrastructure using Cloud Deployment Manager. 
    Tasks include:
    - Developing Deployment Manager templates
    - Launching a Deployment Manager template  

### Ensuring successful operation of a cloud solution  
1. Managing Compute Engine resources. 
    Tasks include:
    - Managing a single VM instance (e.g., start, stop, edit configuration, or delete an instance)
    - SSH/RDP to the instance
    - Attaching a GPU to a new instance and installing CUDA libraries
    - Viewing current running VM inventory (instance IDs, details)
    - Working with snapshots (e.g., create a snapshot from a VM, view snapshots, delete a snapshot)
    - Working with images (e.g., create an image from a VM or a snapshot, view images, delete an image)
    - Working with instance groups (e.g., set autoscaling parameters, assign instance template, create an instance template, remove instance group)
    - Working with management interfaces (e.g., Cloud Console, Cloud Shell, GCloud SDK)
